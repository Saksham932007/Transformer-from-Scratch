output = multi_head.forward(embeddings)
```

**Key Optimizations:**

```python
ff = FeedForward(d_model=512, d_ff=2048)  # With ReLU
ff_gelu = FeedForwardGELU(d_model=512, d_ff=2048)  # With GELU
```

**Dropout**: Regularization with training/eval modes
```python
dropout = Dropout(p=0.1)
dropout.train()  # Enable dropout
output = dropout.forward(inputs)
dropout.eval()   # Disable dropout
```

### 4. Configuration System (`config.py`)

Type-safe configuration with validation and serialization:

```python
from config import TransformerConfig

# Create configuration
config = TransformerConfig(
    d_model=512,
    num_heads=8,
    learning_rate=0.0001,
    dropout_prob=0.1
)

# Save/load configurations
config.save("my_config.json")
loaded_config = TransformerConfig.load("my_config.json")
```

### 5. Training Infrastructure (`training.py`)

    "Artificial intelligence",
    temperature=0.3,  # Low temperature for focused output
    top_k=5
)

# Creative generation  
creative_text = model.complete_sentence(
    "Artificial intelligence", 
    temperature=1.2,  # High temperature for diversity
    top_k=50
)
```

## 🔬 Understanding the Architecture

### Attention Mechanism

The core innovation of transformers is the attention mechanism:

```python
# Scaled dot-product attention
scores = np.dot(query, key.T) / np.sqrt(d_k)
attention_weights = softmax(scores)
output = np.dot(attention_weights, values)
```

### Multi-Head Attention

Allows the model to attend to different aspects simultaneously:

```python
# Split into multiple heads
head_outputs = []
for head in attention_heads:
    head_output = head.forward(embeddings)
    head_outputs.append(head_output)

# Concatenate and project
concatenated = np.concatenate(head_outputs, axis=-1)
output = np.dot(concatenated, W_o)
```

### Layer Normalization

Normalizes inputs across the feature dimension for stable training:

```python
mean = np.mean(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
var = np.var(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
normalized = (x - mean) / np.sqrt(var + eps)
output = gamma * normalized + beta
```

Positional encoding provides info about the order of tokens in a sequence.

- ex. Where a specific word is positioned in a sentence.
- A fixed positional encoding vector is added to each word's embedding.

*NOTE: word embeddings & positional embeddings are separate. Word embeddings capture SEMANTIC MEANING, while positional encodings capture the ORDER of tokens*

## Unembedding

In determining desired output of the transformer (a probability distribution of all possible tokens that can come next in the generating text), a well trained network on the particular dataset is able to determine the next best possible token by:

1. Using a matrix (embedding matrix W_u) that maps the last vector/embedding in the context to a list of 50k values (one for each token in the vocabulary)
2. Function that normalizes this into a probability distribution (softmax)

## Softmax (normalization)

The desired output of a transformer is a probability distribution of all possible tokens that can come next in the generating text

A probability distribution is defined as a sequence of numbers between 0-1, and that sums to 1. Softmax can give any sequence of numbers these criteria

```python
import numpy as np

# given a sequence of numbers, each term `i`

# softmax eqn:      e^i/(sum of e^i for all terms)     

# probability distribution: 
    # 1) all numbers are positive numbers 0-1  (e^i)  
    # sum of all numbers = 1 (sum of e^i of all terms)

seq = [2, 4, 5]
print(np.exp(seq)/np.sum(np.exp(seq)))
# [0.03511903 0.25949646 0.70538451]
```

![Softmax Equation](assets/8-softmaxEqn.png)
![Softmax](assets/6-softmax.png)

## Temperature

With softmax, the constant T added to the denominator of the exponents of e in the equation can cause more creative generated text

- Makes the softmax outputs LESS extreme towards 0 and 1
- This enables more unique text to be generated and different for each generation

![Softmax with Temperature](assets/7-softmaxT.png)
![Logits](assets/9-logits.png)

## Attention

Goal: enable the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when producing an output for a specific token

### Attention Score

A value that represents how much focus (or attention) one word should give to another word in the sequence

(Its derivation is explained later)

### Attention Block

Updates a word's embedding vector in reference to its context. Enables the transfer of information from one embedding to another

Prior to Attention, the embedding vector of each word is consistent, regardless of its context (embedding matrix). Therefore, the motivation of Attention is to update a word's embedding vector depending on its context (i.e. surrounding tokens) to capture this specific contextual instance of the word

![Attention](assets/10-embeddingmatrix.png)

The computation to predict the next token relies entirely on the final vector of the current sequence

Initially, this vector corresponds to the embedding of the last word in the sequence. As the sequence passes through the model's attention blocks, the final vector is updated to include information from the entire sequence, not just the last word. This updated vector becomes a summary of the whole sequence, encoding all the important information needed to predict the next word

![Attention Last Vector](assets/12-attentionlastvector.png)

### Single-Head Attention

Goal: series of computations to produce a new refined set of embeddings

ex. Have nouns ingest the meanings of their corresponding adjectives

![Attention Embeddings](assets/13-attentionEmbeds.png)

#### Query

Query: represents the "question"/"focus" that the single-head attention is asking about the current word
ex. if the current word is "cat" in the sentence "The cat sat on the mat", the Query for "cat" might be asking, "Which other words (Keys) in this sentence should I focus on to understand cat better?"

#### Key

Key: serves as a criterion/reference point against which the Query is compared to determine the relevance of each word
- helps the model understand which other words are related/important to the current word by evaluating how similar/relevant they are to the Query
- ex. in the sentence "The cat sat on the mat", the Key for "sat" might contain info that represents the action/verb aspect of the sentence.
- the Query for "cat" might compare itself to this Key to determine that "sat" is relevant to understanding the action associated with "cat"

#### Attention Score

Attention Score: tells us how relevant each word is
- i.e. value that represents how much focus/attention one word (Query) should give to another word in the sequence (Key)
- computed by comparing the Query vector of the current word with the Key vectors of all other words (including itself) in the sequence
- score indicates relevance/importance to each word in the current word

calculated as: the dot product between the Query and Key vectors
- higher dot product: Key is more "relevant" to Query
- This means the model gives more weight to the Value vector of that word when forming the final representation of the Query word
- ex. in the sentence "The cat sat on the mat," the word "cat" would have a higher influence on the final understanding of "sat" if the model finds "cat" relevant to "sat" based on their Query-Key relationship

Input: Query, Key and Value matrices

Output: matrix where each vector is the weighted sum of the Value vectors, where the weights come from the attention scores (which are based on the dot product of the Query and Key matrices)

Steps:

1. Create weight matrices (initialized randomly initially. same dimensions as embeddings)
2. Get Query, Key values from embed.py (i.e. linear transformation applied to the vectors of the (word embeddings & positional encoding) with weight matrices, for each token)
3. Calculate the attention score (dot product of the Query and Key matrices)
4. Apply masking to the attention scores
5. Apply softmax to the (masked) attention scores (this is called normalization)
6. Use attention scores to weight the Value vectors
7. Output step 6.

![Query W1](assets/14-queryW1.png)
![Query Key 1](assets/15-queryKey1.png)
![Query Key 2](assets/16-queryKey2.png)

The higher the dot product, the more relevant the Query to the Key (i.e. word to another word in the sentence)

![QK Matrix 1](assets/17-qKmatrix1.png)
![QK Matrix 2](assets/18-qKmatrix2.png)
![QK Matrix 3](assets/19-qKmatrix3.png)
![QK Matrix 4](assets/20-qKmatrix4.png)

### Masking

Masking is to prevent later tokens influencing earlier ones during the training process. This is done by setting the entries of the older tokens to -infinity. So when softmax is applied, they are turned to 0.

![Masking](assets/23-masking.png)

Why mask?
- During the train process, every possible subsequence is trained/predicted on for efficiency.
- One training example, effectively acts as many.
- This means we never want to allow later words to influence earlier words (because they essentially "give away" the answer for what comes next/the answer to the predictions)

![Subsequence Training](assets/21-subsequenceTraining.png)

### Softmax

After masking, softmax (normalization) is applied. Masking was done to ensure that later tokens do not affect earlier tokens in the training process. So, the older tokens' entries are set to -infinity during the masking phase, to be transformed into 0 with softmax.

![Masking and Softmax](assets/22-maskingANDsoftmax.png)

### Value

Value matrix W_v is multiplied by the embedding of a word, and this is added to the embedding of the next word

Values essentially answer: IF a word is relevant to adjusting the meaning of something, what exactly should be added to the embedding of that something else, in order to reflect this?

Value: vector that holds the actual info that will be passed along the next layer of the network if a word is deemed relevant based on the attention scores
- after computing the attention scores, these scores are used to weigh the Values
- the weighted sum of these Values is then used as the output for the current word
- continuing with the sentence "The cat sat on the mat", if "sat" (Key) is deemed important for "cat" (Query), the Value associated with "sat" will contribute significantly to the final representation of "cat"
- this helps the model understand that "cat" is related to the action of "sitting"

## Multi-Head Attention

An Attention block is made up of many Attention heads running in parallel (multi-headed attention)

By running many distinct heads in parallel, we are giving the model the capacity to learn many distinct ways that context changes meaning

In other words, multiple instances of Self Attention class running in parallel, each instance with different weight matrices

Steps:

1. Declare multiple heads/instances of Self Attention running in parallel
2. Each head/instance of Self Attention class focuses on different parts of the input by having its own set of weight matrices (W_q, W_k, W_v)
3. Each heads/instances of Self Attention's output is concatenated along the embedding dimension (input of each Self Attention class)
4. Concatenated output is passed through a final linear transformation (a weight matrix)
   - To combine the information from all heads into a single output

### Why Concatenate and Apply a Final Linear Transformation?

The reason for concatenating the outputs from all heads is that each head has learned something different about the input. By concatenating, we combine these insights into a single, unified representation

The final linear transformation is applied to this concatenated output to bring it back to the original embedding dimension

a. Concatenation
In multi-head attention, each head learns different aspects of the input because each head operates on a different part of the embedding (head_dim). By concatenating the outputs from all the heads, we are combining these different learned representations into a single vector that encapsulates all these different insights

b. Final linear transformation
The final linear transformation, done using a weight matrix, mixes the information from the different heads back into a single vector of the original embedding_dim. This step is crucial because it allows the model to create a unified representation that integrates the different perspectives learned by each head
